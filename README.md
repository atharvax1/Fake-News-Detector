# üì∞ Fake News Detector - My First Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my first machine learning project! This is a Fake News Detector built using Python and trained in a Jupyter Notebook. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as real or fake.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project is a work in progress. The current model has a lower accuracy, but I am actively working on improving it with better preprocessing and model tuning.
